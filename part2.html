    <div class="Episode-1">
        <p>Angel reached outside Ritik's home and shouted RItik Ritik Ritik but no reply and was about to give up.
            <br>A boy inside his room on his laptop with headphones hears some sound and ignores thinking it's nothing.
            And hears again and says hannnn aayyyaaa. Sees out of the window there is a girl and asks Who are you? <br>
            Angel: Thankyou so lord(says in excitement). I am so happy to see you Ritik you have no idea how happy.
            <br> Ritik: Ok but who are you agian? <br>Angel: You dont know me, yeah how could you. Ritik i need to tell
            you so many things please please listen i just need 10 minutes of your time please. I know you are thinkin
            who this crazy girl but please 10 minutes is all i ask, please. <br> Ritik: Come on up you weird girl.
            <br>Angel goes up to his room. and he offers a chair to sit. They sit and then Angel says. <br>Angel:
            Ritik before i tell you anything i want to tell you that first listen everything i say no matter how crazy
            it sounds. just listen and wait till the end before you say anything. Deal? <br>Ritik: huh okkk. Sure i can
            do that.
        </p>
        <p>Angel tells everything that happened to Ritik and is hoping if Ritik will even believe her not. <br> Angel:
            I know you must be thinking i might be mental and in need of therepist but what ever i am saying is all
            true. It actually happened. Please belive me. <br> Ritik: I do. <br>Angel: what you belive me? how can you
            belive when a girl like me says all that. <br> Ritik: i really do. I have many questions but yeah i do. I
            always thought that i was the chosen one for something like this like the main charcter of a movie. Always
            felt like my purpose was something bigger than all of us. <br>Angel: Shut up you are not a main charchter
            and nothing happened to you, everything's happening to me. But fine if you belive me that's everything that
            matters. <br>Ritik: So what do you want? what seems the problem? <br> Angel: Problem? the problem is that i
            have no home, no parents and my best friend doesn't recognize me. <br>Ritik: Oh i am your best friends.
            Awesome. <br>Angel: What awesome how can you be so chill with all this. <br> Ritik: I told you i have been
            waiting for this moment my whole life. <br> Angel: yeah makes sense seeing you. you are no differentn then
            my Ritik. Guess i didnt have any affect on you at all. So how do you fix things? <br> Well it seems simple
            you arrived at the same moment you left so if we were to go back and if and that's a big if we reach at the
            same time when you reached there and hope it lets me enter as well and then all we gotta do is stop you from
            killing your father. <br>Angel: i didnt kill my father. It was an accident. <br>Ritik: ok i belive you, you
            crazy girl. But remember we have to be careful we cant change anything. <br> Angel: ok fine lets go right
            now. </p>
        <p>Angel and Ritik starts their journey. They enter the forest and start walking towards the forest. On their
            way Ritik stops for a moment and says you know i have never been here in life. And you wont believe me if i
            say that i just saw this forest last night in my dreams. Angel is shocked on hearing this. <br> Angel:
            What did you see? <br> Ritik: i saw a strange man like he... (Angel inturpts) <br>Angel: Like he was
            showing you a way. How do you know that i didnt tell you anything about the dream. <br> Ritik: You tell me?
            How do you know about it? It was my dream. And what dream are you talking about. <br>Ritik had the same
            dream the day before i entered teh waterfall. <br>Ritik: That's strange. How can that be. Seems like your
            Ritik and i are connected somehow. We better not do anything wrong or create any more of us or any other
            realities. <br>They start walking and reach the waterfall. <br>Angel: Ritik do you hear that? That sound.
            <br>Ritik: What sound? Just kidding. I hea it. wow it's so cool. Music coming from waterfall like there is a
            hidden speaker somewhere. <br>Angel: Ritik, this is not the right time to kid okk. <br>Ritik: Sorry.
            <br>Angel: Ritik i am scared. i dont want to go inside. Last time when i was there i someone pulled me
            inside. <br>Ritik: oh what do you think was that pulled you inside? Could it be that strange man. <br>
            Angel: I dont know Ritik i didnt feel a hand i felt like someone or something entirely pulled me inside.
            Ritik i dont want to go. Ritik can you go alone? you know everything that you have to do. i am scared.
            <br>Ritik: Angel if it was possible i would have gone alone. But if i go youll still be here in this
            reality and you dont belong here, if you wish to go back to your life you have to go through the past and
            stop your father from dying but dont worry we will do it totgether and once its done we can go back to our
            lives again with this experience like it never happened. Is that ok? <br> Angel: yes. Thankyou Ritik i owe
            you. <br> Ritik raises his hand and holds Angel's hand and they start walking towards the waterfall. And
            they enter and they vanish.
        </p>
        <p>In the next scene Ritik and Angel both are lying on the ground not on the rock but somewhere near where
            Angel had first landed. (Camera showing three of them in the same scene but far enough they dont see each
            other.) Angel and Ritik wakes up with dry clothes and Angel(2) notices Angel(1) and tells Ritik to hide
            and they both hide. <br>Angel: Ritik there she goes it will take her around an hour before she comes back
            here. lets move and set position. What are you thinking? <br> I huh... i am thinking about the last thing i
            said to you when we were in the waterfall. And something doesnt add up i feel like i am missing something,
            someting important. Just cant put my mind around it. <br> Angel: think about it while we walk. we dont have
            much time. And we cant be seen so be careful. <br> Ritik: i know that very well. you have no idea how ecited
            i am to be in the past there are many thins i want to do. But seeing what happened to you i cant take
            chances. So you have no idea how difficult it is for me but i undersand. lets go <br> They start walking and
            this time they take a different route so they dont meet Mr.Miyagi. <br>Angel: That's my father.(from a
            distance)<br> Ritik: Oh wow he looks so young. Sad he got killed by her daughter at such young age.
            <br>Angel: Ritik i said no jokes. <br>Ritik: I still think we are missing something. <br>Angel: Lets wait
            ahead you can think there. she'll be here soon. <br>Ritik and Angel choose a spot for resting. They sit
            down there and start waiting for Angel(1) while Ritik is still thinking. <br>Ritik: Oh god we screwd up.
            Screwed up really bad. I never should have come here. <br> Angel: what are you talking about? why are you
            saying that? Ritik look i see her she's down. <br>Ritik: oh no. its too late now. What will i do now.
            aaaahhhhh. <br>Angel: Ritik calm down calm down. will you tell me what happened. <br>Ritik: What happened?
            What happened? My life is destroyed that's what happened. <br> Angel: what do you mean? <br>Ritik: You
            remeber what happened with you. you killed your or whatevr happened to your father and when you came back
            your life was completely chnaged you ceised to exist but but because of that i got this amazing life. From
            what you have told me about your Ritik i was really happy with my life. That i didnt turn out to be some
            kind of college dropout who wasted his life watching tv. I passed my jee and am in the best college in the
            country. And i am planning to go to Germany with my amazing friends. My life is awesome. And when we go
            through that waterfall i'll lose all that and will be left with nothing. like you dont belong here, i dont
            belong in your reality. You altready have a Ritik and me being there will only complicate his ruined life.
            <br>You can't say that about my best friend. you might be in different places but you dont know how much
            similar you two are. your intersts, jokes the way you talk and everything. And its ok we wont stop her you
            can go back to your home. I'll manage somehow. <br> Ritik: I am really sorry. But i can't let you do that
            even if it were the only possible thing i wouldnt i made a promise. And besides if we dont do that we'll
            just start a loop and this forest will be full of people. Cause if we wont stop her she'll do the exact same
            thing that you did. And soon two more Ritik and Angel will be here and this will carry on till someone
            breaks the loop which i think will be impossible to do. So we should hurry up and do what we came here to
            do. <br>Angel: I think i am going to die from hearing all this. But wait why dont we already see other
            Ritik and Angel's. Are they hiding? <br> Ritik: I think maybe not. They arent here yet, its just a theory.
            But i say it's like this everytime there is a loop there's always something that starts it, and i think here
            we are that we are the first ones on the loop. So it totally depends on us if we let this loop create or
            not. Your father dying wont have any affect on the loop. It all matters on Angel(1). We have to stop her
            before she reached the portal. Cause if she does it will get hell of complicted and the more we try to fix
            it the more we will damage it. So we better be careful. What we do. <br> Angel: Ok so yeah lets. lets be
            careful. here she coms. <Br>Ritik: Oh no. <br>Angel OH god. now what? what can go worse thant this. <br>
            Ritik: I just noticed something. And it's bad but we dont have to worry about that now. We gotta deal with
            her first. <br>Angel: yeah ok let's be quick before it's too late.</Br>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>Ritik and Angel starts following her quitely as she gets near to her father. i think we should stop her here now
        its clear Angel said. <br>Ritik: Yeah i think so too. What should we do? <br> Angel: leave it to me. I'll talk
        to her. i know her better than anyone <br> Ritik: ok be carefull. <br> Angel stop Angel and she tells her
        something in her ear Ritik sees from distance whispering about something. Ritik is surprised how well everything
        is going and wondering what did she whisper. Angel gets upto speed. And she agrees to wait and change the path
        she was headed on and walk back with Ritik </p> The three of hide and spy on Mr. miyagi. and when they are
    assured that he is safe. They start heading back to the waterfall. The three reach the waterfall and then Ritik says
    Angel have to tell you something, can i talk to you in private. <br> Angel: Dont bother i know what you have to
    say. <br> Angel takes a screw driver out of her pocket and slicks it on Angel's(1) throat. <br>
