    <div class="Episode-1">
        <p>Glimpse of a strange man in the different parts of forest leading to a waterfall. The camera follows the man.
            And as it approches the waterfall, Ritik wakes up from the dream. Huh.. weird dream Ritik said on a sunday
            morning. Ritik gets up calls Angel. <br> Ritik: "Hey you up for today?" <br> Angel: "Yeah. And dont forget
            to bring the stuff". <br> Ritik: "sure". <br> Call ends. </p>
        <p>Ritik hops on skateboard ang get's going to Ankits's place. Ritik reaches Angel's home and see Ankits's
            father. <br> Ritik: "Good day sir, how are you doing?" <br> Mr. Miyagi: "Great kiddo all well what about you
            young man?" <br> Ritik: all good here as well. <br> Angel enters and packs her bag. <br> Mr. Miyagi: "be
            back by lunch time. kids enjoy" </p>
        <p>They start walking towards the waterfall. On the way ritik remeberes what he saw in his dream and starts
            wondering. <br> Angel: "what happened why are you so quite?" Ritik: "it's nothing" <br> and they carry on
            walking. They reach the waterfall and they relex on top of a rock. Suddenly <br> Ritik: "I had a really
            weird dream last night. It seemed so real like it wasnt a dream at all." <br>Angel: THe hell you are
            talking about? You high already. What did you see?. <br> Ritik: "i saw an odd man and it seeemed like he was
            showing me a way. <br>Angel: A way! To where? <br>Ritik: To a portal. <br> Angel: Yeah Right a portal.
            <br>It's true and portal was right there between the waterfall. The men went through it ane vanished. <br>
            Angel: You definetly high bro. <br> Strange melody coming from the waterfall and Angel hears it. <br>
            Ritik: What happened. What is it? <br> Angel: It's nothing i thought i heard something. (in a scared and
            angry voice)It's because of you. I know you got a thing for science finction time travel and all but keep
            those things to you. You are crazy dont make me one. <br> Then they come back home.
        </p>
        <p>At night Angel gets Ritik's message saying "i noticed a scar on your neck how did you get it?" she replied
            "it's nothing i was working in the field just that. "ok good night bro" ritik replied.Later while Angel is
            in her bed and wonders what was the sound she heard. Just hallucination she thinks and gets to sleep. The
            next morning we find Angel somewhat upset and crying running towards the waterfall. And when she's close to
            it she again hears the sound. As she approches it the frequency starts incresing and increasing. She passes
            her hand through the waterfall and the music stops. Surprised for a moment thinking it was nothing. And then
            suddely she gets pulled inwards and vanishes. </p>
        <p>In the next scene we see Angel lying on top of the rock but her clothes all dried. After we moments she
            coughs and wakes up and wonders what just happened, was it all a dream and why was she lying their. Then she
            starts walking back towards her home. On the way everything seemed the same but little different. Everything
            was greener and not a lot more trees and the way back home also seemed difffent. Which she didn't notice at
            first. But when she noticed it she was a bit surprised. But not as surprised when she came back to her home
            only to find that her home was gone there were only trees and nothing left of her home or garden. She was so
            cofused and going crazy. She sat down and was thinking what happened. After some time she thought to call
            Ritik but there was no signal or her phone so she decided to visit Ritik and tell him all this and maybe
            he'll make some sense. She went down to the road running to ride to scooty to Ritik's. But as she was
            approaching the road she was shocked, shocked to see most of the houses vanished. Road was stll there but
            hardly any vehicles passing by. She just could'nt belive her eyes what she was seeing. Then she heard a
            singing near the stream. She followed and then she saw a girl almost same her age filling water from the
            stream wearing tradtional himachali clothes. She went to near and the girl noticed her. <br>
            The girl: Hey who are you? what is it that you are wearing? (pointing at her jeans and hoodie). <br> Angel:
            It's my jeans and hoodie. What you haven't seen these clothes before. More impprtantnly where are all the
            houses. <br> The girl: Oh you must be videshi. You are from delhi right. Yeah here in the village we dont
            have as many houses as you have in cities. <br> Angel taking a moment and realising everything.

            <br><br><br>
        <div class="here">YAHAN tk pda tha us din. aaage ki sotory niche</div>
        <br> Ankia:
        (panicing)Oh Ritik man what have you done i told you not to mess up with my head but still you did. I am in
        the past, arent I. i rekon because of all your time travelling stories. Dear, what year is it? <br> The
        girl: What, what do you mean? what year is it? you dont know it's 2000. <br> Angel: (whispering) please say
        2023. Oh no i am screwd. See you later. Bye. <br>The girl: Wait what? Who are you what's your name? <br>
        Angel starts running. She runs and runs hoping that she can go back to her time through the waterfall. She
        reaches teh forest and while running she hears a sound. A sound of someone cutting the woods. She follows it
        and sees a young man who seems familiar to her what she couldnt put a finger on it who he is. He sees her
        too and asks her. <br> The man: Hey girl what are you doing here? Ther are many wild animals out here you
        should'nt be here alone. Where are you going? let me accompany you. What's your name? <br> Angel: It's
        Angel. what's your?(still wondering how he seems so familiar.) <br> The man: It's Mr. Miyagi. </p>
        <p>Angel realises that he is no other than her own father. And agrees for him to be her companion. And they
            start walking towards the waterfall. The way to waterfall isn't that good. After some time Mr. miyagi's foot
            suddenly slips and and falls down rolling and hits his head on a rock. Angel goes running adn tries to help
            him but there was nothing she could do. There was so much bleeding and he died at that instant. Angel got
            so scared that she started running running thinking that this dream would end. She reached the waterfall and
            again stated hearing the sound. For a moment she was so happy that she could go back home. But then she
            realised what just happened. And was worried what the consecuences wll be. So she just went through it </p>
        <p>Again she was lying on the same rock with her clothes dry. She woke up and said i am never getting high again
            thinking that it was all her hallucination. She checked her phone and saw everything working and checked the
            year. she was relieved. Then she started walking backing home. When she was about to reach her home, she saw
            her neighnours house and felt great joy. She took a deep breath and stated walking again. A smile on her
            ways could tell how glas she was. But that smiled changed into a frown when she found that her house was
            still missing. She started crying and just lay on the earth. After few minutes she pulled herself together
            and got up took a breadth and started thinking what she should do. She turned her phone on and searched for
            Ritik and called him. cause she didnt want to be alone anymore she was fed up. Someone picked the call but
            it wasnt Ritik, Angel found. Wondering what should she do. Then suddenly she remebered all the theories
            that Ritik had shared with her about Time travel. And suddenly it all made sense to her. She remeberd that
            She an Ritik both had bought the sim on the day. And if she's rigth he still must be at his home and she
            knows why his number isn't working. So she runs and runs to Ritik's home hoping that he would be there. </p>
        <p>Angel reached outside Ritik's home and shouted RItik Ritik Ritik

        <p>Part 1 ends in suspense</p>
