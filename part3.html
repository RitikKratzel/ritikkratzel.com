        <p>Previously on the "Title": Blah Blah Blah <br> Ritik: Ankita I have to tell you something, can
            i talk to you in private. <br> Ankita: Dont bother i know what you have to say. <br> Ankita takes a screw
            driver out of her pocket and slicks it on Angel's(1) throat. <br> Ankita(1)'s blood spills out and she
            leans back and falls on the water. her body is completely under the water. <br>Ritik: shocked and says what
            did you do? What's wrong with you? <br> Ankita: What needed to be done. I know what you were going to tell
            me. Everyone thinks me as a fool like i dont understand anything. Even you ritik even you. <br> What are you
            talking about? Are you sure what i was going to tell you. <br>Ankita: i know you were going to tell about us
            her and me. That when we go through the waterfall and both of us will be back in the same time and place. i
            had my doubts since i landed here with you but what you said to me in the forest all that crap about loops
            and i dont know what bulshit, it only confirmed my suspeciousns. <br>Ritik: ok but why did you have to kill
            her? There was no need to do that. <br> Ankita: Yes there was. You know nothing about me. You have no idea
            what i have been through. <br>Ritik: You are a monster, that's what it is. <br>That's why i cant have her
            there in the future. I have done things more than she ever knew she was capable of. And once you let in the
            darkness, there's no coming back. And if Ritik finds out he'll stop being my friend. He's the only one in my
            life who is always there for me. He's like a brother to me. And if she is there, he'll always choose her.
            And that's why i cant let her live. <br>Ritik: You could have made it work, there could have been some other
            option. <br>Ankita: Ritik you dont understand. This waterfall made it very clear. It talked to me.
            <br>Ritik: what do you mean it talked to you? <br>Ankita: When we came here i didnt hear the voice. But she
            did i could tell her by her face. And after all i have done i just couldnt let her beat me in all this. So i
            knew what i had to do. And i was right the moment i slit her throat i started hearing the music. <br>Ritik:
            What have you done that's so bad that you had to kill her. <br>Ankita: You know nothing. Let me tell you.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p> Scene of Ankita and Ankita whispering again. But this time we see what they are whispering. Ankita whisperse
            "i know what you are about to do. Ritik is here with me dont let him see you. Leave it you'll regret it
            later. And she agrees. Then in the next scene the camera man follows Ankita(1) from the first time she was
            in the past. We see that she comes across some cut woods and tools. And she recognises a watch that her
            father wears. So she understands it's her father used to wear. And she recognises that its her father. she
            hears her father wessling while he is peeing. And she hides. When he comes back to work she comes out and
            acts like she just came walking and she talks to her like she told to Ritik. And they start walking but when
            they reach a kind of small cliff she says "i am sorry but i have to do this." And she pushes him and he
            falls down rolling and hits a tree. He says help, help please. Ankita goes down to him, he says what have i
            done and ankita replies nothing yet. And she grabs an axe from his bag and smashes it on his face. Dead and
            she covered in his blood. </p>
        <p>In the next scene we are back at th ewaterfall. And ritik realises everything that has happened. And he
            slowlly moves backwards towards the waterfall. And ankita notices. <br>Ankita: Ritik are you tring to run.
            Are you scared of me. You think i am a monster dont you? You have no idea what i have been through how big
            of a moster my father is. He used to beat me everyday and my mother she just sat there and see it everyday.
            But well if you think of me like this i can imagine what Ritik might think of me if he finds out. <br>Ritik:
            You dont have to do this Ankita. i'll leave this town and live far far away i wont tell anything to Ritik i
            promise. <br>Ankita: I believe you Ritik but i just cant take any chances. <br> Ankita cuts Ritik's hand a
            little bit and he bleeds but somehow he is able to run away and gets through the waterfall. Ankita follows
            him. And now they are back in 2023 the original one. And they are respwaned in different places. Ritik on
            the rock and Ankita on top of the waterfall. She sees him and starts running after him. Ritik starts running
            too while he is bleeding. After some time Ritik thinks of distracting her. He lets his blood flow like he's
            going back to town, he realise there's nothing there for him. so he wraps his bleeding hand around and
            starts walking wback to waterfall cause he got an idea how he can travel back to his time and reality so he
            goes back to the waterfall. And enters it. Now he's back in 1999. And now we are back with the first camera
            angle where we see Ankita(1), Ankita(2)Ritik(2) and Ritik(3) in the same scene. But none of them are able to
            see each other. Thinks thinks of a plan to get tback to his time and also save Mr. miyagi and without
            creating any loops. He knows that Ankita will be back to when she doesnt find Ritik. And when she comes back
            she might kill Ritik (2) so he thinks about saving his as well. And we are back where Ritik and Ankita sees
            Mr. miyagi. And Ritik is following them. And when he thinks about going to them and talking. We see
            Ankita(3) jumping on top of him with a a knife. They start fighting and fghting and Ritik throws dirt in her
            eyes. And he gets a chance to kill her with the knife but she doesnt he just throws the knife away, And he
            quickly goes to Ritik and Ankita and talks to them. <br>Ankita and Ritik: Oh whhhat. what's happening.
            <br>Ritik(2): Did we create a loop. Oh man i thought we will be very careful to not to make one.
            <br>Ritik(3): You didt mean to. It just happened. Now listen we dont have much time. Ritik what you are
            missing is that if you do this you wont be able to get back, not in the same world for that matter.
            <br>Ritik(2): Oh yeah that's what i have been missing. <br>Ritik(3): Yes we dont have much time Ritik we
            have to get through the waterfall wuich before Ankita(1) is stopped. Or well end up creating more and more
            loops. <br>Ritik(2): I undetand. <br>Ritik(3): Let me talk to Ankita for a moment. <br>They talk in private.
            <br>Ritik(3): I know what you did, ad what you are capable of. I just want you to know that i understand.
            You know what you have to do now and that's your business. We are leaving no hard feelings. <br>Ankita: Can
            i trust you? <br>Ritik: You just have to. This all is much bigger than us we have to do it. <br>Ankita: Ok i
            undersand <br>Ritik(2) and Ritik(3) start running towards the waterfall as quick as they can. They reaach
            the waterall. </p>
            <p>Ritik(3): Do you hear it? <br> Ritik(2): Yes i do. <br> Ritik(3): I do too. <br> They starting walking towards the waterfall and as they are close to it. Ankita comes from back and hits Ritik with a rock and he gets fainted and grabs Ritik(2) and points the knife on his throat. Ritik(2): <br>Ankita: A bit shocked <br>Ritik(3): You dont have to do this, we'll be out of here and we will get back to our timeline. So there's way no way i can tell Ritik anything about this, you have to belive me. please let us go. <br>How's that possible? huh? <br>Ritik: If we go through here right now we can get back to my world. It's the lopphole we have to get through it before Ankita(1) is stoppped from killing your father. It's the only way to not make any more loops or create a new reality. You have to believe me. <br>You can run and get back. why wont you? You know if i kill him nothing will happen to you. Then why dont you? <br>Ritik: I know that if you kill him nothing will happen to me but still i cant just let him die even tough we are different people i wouldnt want him to die. He could have been. we htwo have different minds but i feel for me. It's all messes up but i cant just let him die. <br>Ankita: In tears, Ritik i have done very vbad things in the last 24 hours that i havent done in the last 24 years. i killed my father killed myself which is funny and almost killed you. You are too good of a friend for me. You are the brother i never had. You dont deserve a friend like me. I am sorry for everything that i have done. Yoou can go. <br>Ritik: Really. Ankita you know you are not a bad person. It's the choices that are bad. You can stil change it try better the next time. And i hope that you will stop yourself from killing you. <br>Akita: i'll try. You better hurry. Any minute now. <br> Ritk: goodbye Ankita. Once we leave, evrythign will depend on you. so you better not make things worse. i'll be gone and wont be able to come back. (at least the same me). so think wisely what you'll do.   </p>
            <p>Both ritik enter the waterfall and they vanish. Now in the voice of Ankita she gives a speech. and....</p>
